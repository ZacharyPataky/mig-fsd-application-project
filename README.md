# Merchants Insurance Group Full-Stack Developer Demo

This GitHub repository contains the code for the Full-Stack Developer demo created during the hiring process for Merchants Insurance Group. The demo is a one-page responsive layout that connects to a back-end service. The front-end contains a table holding employees and their respective data, and it fetches this data from a back-end service. Additionally, the demo includes the ability to add, update, and delete employees, providing full CRUD capabilities.

## Application Versions

This repository contains two versions of the application:

1. Angular, Django, and MySQL
2. ASP.NET and React

### Angular, Django, and MySQL

This version of the application uses Angular with Material UI in the front-end and Django and MySQL in the back-end. The code demonstrates how to use a fully-fledged database, although this was not a requirement for the demo.

### ASP.NET and React

The second version of the application uses ASP.NET and React. The ASP.NET code is fully operational and can be tested using Postman. However, the front-end is still incomplete, and you can only see the beginning of the React code.

## Running the Application
